Description: Based on individual market shares of all participants in a
    market or space or their respective sales figures, the package offers
    a set of different structural and concentration measures frequently -
    and not so frequently - used in research and in practice. Measures can
    be calculated in groups or individually. The calculated measure or the
    resulting vector in table format should help practitioners make more
    informed decisions.
